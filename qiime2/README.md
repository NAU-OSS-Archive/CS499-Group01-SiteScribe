# Details about Qiime2

## Governance Model

It appears to us that this project is a Consensus-Based Democracy Model where small changes are appreciated and OK and anything that is complex usually requires a discussion. It seems to be like there isn’t a direct leader and the contributions are well distributed between contributors. Looks like this is just a really nice community.

## Finding an issue to work on
  
  * Does the project use tags to identify easy tasks?

Yes, the project repository uses tags to help specify what issues are currently available with varying difficulty, scope, and languages. For the issue tags: [Link](https://github.com/qiime2/qiime2/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc) 

  * If yes, which tag(s) is(are) used?


Specific tags that stood out to us are the “enhancement” section with the “good first issue”, “Hacktoberfest”, and “help wanted” tags. A specific “bug” tag we saw was “bug-type:1|cosmetic”. Lastly, they have “difficulty” tags too and the one that stood out to us was the “diff:1|beginner” tag.
